\begin{newquestion}{\textbf{11}~~}
Implement the perceptron learning algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:perceptron}, and compare the obtained binary classifier with the one obtained from logistic regression. 
\end{newquestion}

\begin{newquestion}{\textbf{12}~~}
Understand how learning rate in the perceptron learning algorithm affects the learning results. Draw a curve to exhibit the change of accuracy with respect to the learning rate. 
\end{newquestion}

\begin{newquestion}{\textbf{13}~~}
Use the perceptron learning algorithm to work with the XOR dataset in Example~\ref{example:xor}, and check the accuracy. 
\end{newquestion}




\begin{newquestion}{\textbf{14}~~}
Assuming that all weights in Figure~\ref{fig:twolayerxor}, i.e., those numbers 1 and -1, need to be learned. Can you adapt the perceptron learning algorithm to learn the weights? 
\end{newquestion}


\begin{newquestion}{\textbf{15}~~}
Understand the equivalence of applying matrix expression to compute the outputs for a dataset and the computation of outputs for individual inputs.
