\subsection*{Explainability and Interpretability}\label{sec:explainableAI}

To gain trust from human users in operational use, it is essential to enable them to understand the decisions a machine learning model has made. Explainable AI is a topic with fierce discussions lately. The reader is referred to recent surveys such as \cite{HUANG2020100270} for more explanations on the recent progress in this direction.
