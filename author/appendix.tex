\part{Appendix: Mathematical Foundations and Competition}\label{part:math}


The appendix includes contents that serves as the preliminary knowledge of the technical chapters, including probability theory and linear algebra. Only very basic contents are included, and the readers are referred to dedicated textbooks for more in-depth contents. 
Moreover, we also include some contents for probabilistic graphical model, in addition to the introductory content already provided in Chapter~\ref{chap:pgmfeature}. 
Finally, we also include a competition that is designed for a group of students to learn adversarial attack and training by competing with each other's solutions.
