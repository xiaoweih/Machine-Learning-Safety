%\noindent Use the template \emph{part.tex} together with the document class SVMono (monograph-type books) or SVMult (edited books) to style your part title page and, if desired, a short introductory text (maximum one page) on its verso page.

This part is focused on a specific topic in modern machine learning, i.e., deep learning. First of all, we introduce a few fundamental aspects, including perceptron and why we need multi-layer structures, how the convolutional neural networks extract features layer by layer, the back-propagation learning algorithm, and the functional layers of convolutional neural networks. Then, we will focus on the safety and security vulnerabilities of deep learning, explaining uncertainty estimation, adversarial attack on the robustness, poisoning attack, model stealing, membership inference and model inversion.
