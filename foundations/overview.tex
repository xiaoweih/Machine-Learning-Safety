%A learning-enabled system $\mathcal{A}$ is a system where there are at least one machine learning components. Let $M$ be a trained machine learning model and $\phi$ a safety property, it is possible that there might be a set $D_{op}$ of \emph{operational} instances on which the model $M$ may be asked to predict. 

%A safety property is either to determine whether the model $M$ and one of the instances $\textbf{x} \in D_{op}$ satisfy the property, written as $M,\textbf{x}\models \phi$, or to determine whether an attacked 


In addition to this Part~\ref{chap:intro} which provides foundation knowledge and definitions of safety and security properties, this book includes the following several parts: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Part~\ref{part:simple} introduces several traditional machine learning algorithms, focusing on the techniques that can exploit the safety and security  vulnerabilities of these machine learning algorithms. 
    \item Part~\ref{part:simple} introduces deep learning, focusing on convolutional neural networks and the techniques that can exploit their safety and security vulnerabilities. 
    \item Part~\ref{chap:verification} presents the robustness verification techniques that can determine if a neural network is robust with provable guarantee. 
    \item Part~\ref{chap:advtraining} presents techniques to improve the the robustness, generalisation, and privacy of convolutional neural networks. 
    \item Part~\ref{chap:pgm} introduces probabilistic graphical models, probabilistic inferences on a probabilistic graphical model, and how a neural network can be abstracted into a probabilistic graphical model. 
    \item Part~\ref{chap:lookfurther} discusses several aspects that have not been discussed but related to machine learning safety and security. 
\end{itemize}
Moreover, in the Appendix, we include mathematical foundations in Part~\ref{part:math} and materials for student  competition in Part~\ref{part:competitions}.
